# Custom Media Features
## Enhancements for the Media suite

This adds a few tweaks to make Media on Drupal better.

### What it does
- Adds clickthrough functionality to a Media Browser page view — just make a display on the View
- Adds an “Add Media” menu link — recommend setting the above page View to admin/content/media to act as the menu parent
- Adds a file display formatter to allow a straight, actual URL path link to media — good for linking PDF docs
